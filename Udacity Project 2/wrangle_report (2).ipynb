    "\n",
    "The first thing I did when I started working on this project was to manually download the file called \"twitter-archive-enhanced.csv\" provided for us by Udacity and stored it in a dataframe called \"twitter_archive\". After that, I used the requests library to programmatically download the file \"image-predictions.tsv\" from Udacity's server and named the dataframe \"image_prediction\". Lastly, I downloaded the tweet_json text file that was provided to us by Udacity and selected the columns I was interested in; id, retweet_count and favorite_count.\n",

    "I got my 3 dataframes; twitter_archive, image_prediction, tweet_json and I moved on to assessing phase.\n",

    "5. I Renamed columns for better description\n",

    "7. I Drop rows that have p1_dog, p2_dog, p3_dog values set to false\n",
